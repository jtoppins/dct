Mission scripting framework for persistent DCS missions.

Provide a set of tools to allow mission designers to easily create scenarios
for persistent dynamic campaigns within the Digital Combat Simulator (DCS)
game world.

## Description

**D**ynamic **C**ampaign **T**ools relies on content that can be built
directly in the mission editor, these individuals need little to no
programming skills to provide content to a DCT enabled mission.

Scenarios are created through a theater definition consisting of templates,
created in the Mission Editor and configuration files. There is an initial
learning curve but it is no more difficult than initially learning the DCS
Mission Editor.
